This repository showcases some projects completed while applying machine learning algorithms to provided data.

Update to watch out for: Beginning from September, I will be working on a project that has to do with predicting Emotional Index.
---> July 31, 2023 - Aug 04, 2023: Getting to read about Neuroscience.
---> August 05, 2023: Understanding SUS and NPS.
---> Understanding how to Calculate Net Promoter Score (NPS):
------> NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
------> High NPS implies Business Growth.
------> 1-6 (Detractors)
------> 7-8 (Passives)
------> 9-10 (Promoters)

---> Talking NPS: NPS is a straightforward way to measure how likely customers are to recommend a company/product/service to their friends or colleagues.
---> The NPS will typically fall between -100 and 100.
August 10, 2023
---> Talking SUS: SUS is a measure of how user-friendly a product/system is.
---> The SUS score will typically fall between 0 and 100. 
---> A higher score indicates better usability and user-friendliness, while a lower score suggests more usability issues and challenges.
---> It is important to interpret the test results contextually. 
I must say that day in day out, I get obsessed about this project, being something related for me and not out of my comfort zone.
I look forward to an amazing experience with my supervisors working on this project.
