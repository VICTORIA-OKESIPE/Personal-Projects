## By: Victoria Oluwakemi OKESIPE ##

### Statement of Purpose ###

The purpose of this repository is as a project for creating a prediction model that predicts the whether or not loan should be given to a bank customer, and building a simple frontend application to make the model publicly available using Streamlit.

### Data Description ###

The data we will be using for this project is the [loan_data](https://zindi.africa/competitions/data-science-nigeria-challenge-1-loan-default-prediction) dataset, which is publicly available via Zindi.
